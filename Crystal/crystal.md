# Chapter5

### Functional requirements

 **Time Synchronization:**
 
1. The system must support time synchronization among control subsystems using IRIG-B format as UTC. This ensures that time-sensitive operations across the Gemini system are coordinated and accurate.

**Self-Testing:**

2. The system must be capable of running self-tests and reporting the results as OK, BAD, or WARNING. This functionality allows subsystems to detect problems that may affect their operation and report their status accordingly.

**Logging:**

3. The system must support logging at specified levels. Logging is essential for recording system activities, errors, and important events, providing valuable information for troubleshooting and analysis. 

**Asynchronous Communication:**

4. Communication via a route must be asynchronous, with commands available to establish synchronization as needed. Asynchronous communication allows for flexibility and responsiveness in data transmission and command execution.

**Command Implementation:**

5. Commands must be represented as ASCII strings, and procedures must be provided for constructing/deconstructing/routing command strings. This requirement ensures that commands are transmitted and processed in a standardized and efficient manner.


## Non-functional requirements

**IOC Commands:**

1. The Gemini system must support various IOC commands, including AwaitItem, SetCallback, ClearCallback, LocateItem, GetValue, PutValue, StartStream, StopStream, SetEvent, and ClearEvent. These commands are essential for interacting with the Input/Output Controller (IOC) subsystems and accessing the local databases within the system.

**Data Communications:**

2. The system must be capable of transmitting commands and data across the network using different methods:

* 2.1 Direct Transmission: The most common means of command transfer from the Observatory Control System to the subsystems.

* 2.2 Channel Routing: Commands and data may be routed through a channel, which may involve intelligent channels responsible for data conversion. Channels may have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both, and may use separate physical routes to prevent interference with normal command streams.

* 2.3 Broadcast Signals: Some commands and data signals are broadcast across the control system, allowing any subsystem to examine and respond as appropriate. For example, critical system failures might trigger a broadcast ShutDown command.

**General purpose command:**

3. The system must support a range of general-purpose commands, including GetState, GetID, GetConfiguration, SetStatus, and SetLogging. These commands are crucial for obtaining the internal state of subsystems, retrieving unique identification tags, obtaining detailed configuration information, and setting the status and logging levels of subsystems.

**Command Structure**

4. All commands must adhere to a specific structure, including unique identification, source, target, opcode, and parameter set. This structured approach ensures consistency and traceability in command execution.
