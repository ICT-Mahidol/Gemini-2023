- The system assesses real-time operating systems and cross-development system software for compatibility with the goals of the Gemini Project. The selection process takes into account both the suitability of real-time operating systems and the availability of cross-support development environments.

- The system should consider the offline data reduction facility as separate from the Gemini software. However, the system allows for the connection of such software into the Gemini system if interface routines are developed for integration.

- The system must requires compatibility of internal data formats across workstations used for development.

- The system must ensures the availability of SCSI-interface peripherals.

- The system should take into account reliability, manufacturer support, and upgrade capability when selecting the final target systems for development.

- The system must maintain a memory-resident database at the core of each Input/Output Controller (IOC).

- The system’s components must interact with the database through designated database access routines.

- The system’s components must remain unaware of the underlying data structures of the database.

- The system should provide a high-level abstraction through database access routines.

- The system should provide a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing records within the database.

- Database access should be optimized for efficiency to ensure fast and responsive interactions with the system.

## Command

  

### Functional

  

****5.2 Command Structure****

  

- The general command structure in the system should contain of Command_ID which is an identification that is unique to that specific instance of each command, source, and target which indicate the originator and the recipient for the command.

- The source command structure in the system must contain of Opcode and Parameter set.

  

****5.3 General purpose commands****

  

- The system should have the following command to obtain the information about the state of the subsystem.

	- *_GetVersion_* The subsystem returns its version identification as a string value.

	- *_GetStatus_* The subsystem reports its current status. It should contain the status with the following meaning

		- DOWN - the subsystem is not operational

		- BOOTED - the subsystem has been booted, but not yet configured

		- CONFIGURING - the system is in the process of configuring (Steven).

		- CONFIGURED - the subsystem is configured, but not yet initialized

		- INITIALIZING - the subsystem is doing initialization actions

		- RUNNING - the subsystem is running at observing level

		- MAINTENANCE - the subsystem is running at maintenance level

		- SIMULATION - the subsystem is running in simulation mode

		- DISABLED - the subsystem is functional, but has been commanded to ignore control commands

		- SHUTDOWN - the subsystem is in the process of shutting down

		- LOCKED - an interlock exists on this subsystem.

	- *_GetState_* The internal state of the subsystem will returned as one of:

		- READY - the subsystem is fully operational, but currently idle.

		- BUSY_ON command - the subsystem is working, and currently processing the indicated command.

		- NOT_READY - the subsystem is not responding to commands at this time.

	- *_GetID_* The subsystem reports its unique identification tag.

	- *_GetConfiguration_* for detailed configuration information and detailed results of self-tests.

- Configuration information from *_GetConfiguration_* should ****includes details of any settings internal configurations (filters, positions, etc.) and, if requested, the detailed results of any self-tests.**

- The system should have following generic commands

	- *_SetStatus_* The target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the specified status argument

	- *_SetConfiguration_* This command directs the downloading of a configuration from the host to the target subsystem.

	- *_RunTest_* The subsystem runs a self-test and reports the result as one of

		- OK - the subsystem has detected no problems, it is running within specifications

		- BAD - the subsystem has detected problems that prevent its successful operation

		- WARNING - the subsystem has detected a problem that may prevent it from operating to full specification, but does not prevent it from functioning at this time

	- *_SetLogging_* Logging by the indicated subsystem is set to occur at the specified level.

- The system should be able to operate the command *_SetConfiguration_* with *_GetConfiguration_* to provide 'sequencing points' for subsystem restarts or roll backs.

- The system should have an argument describing a particular self-test when running the specific subsystem, the argument are given in Work Package Description.

  

****5.4 Data communications commands****

  

- The system should have the following communication commands

	- *_OpenRoute_* A route of the indicated class is being established for some item. The command includes sufficient information on the route to permit the IOC to communicate through the route.

	- *_CloseRoute_* A previously-opened route is being closed. Modules at either end of the channel are notified and take appropriate action.

	- *_ResetRoute_* The route is to be reinitialized. Modules receiving this command are to flush buffers associated with this route and reset operating parameters to initial conditions.

	- *_TestRoute_* A test message is transmitted across the route. All receivers on the route are to respond with an identification.

	- *_AwaitItem_* The module sending this command is blocked until information is received via the indicated route, or a timeout occurs.

	- *_SetCallback_* A callback is established to process data across the indicated route.

	- *_ClearCallback_* A previously established callback is removed.

  

****5.5 IOC commands****

  

- The system should have the following commands for IOC-based subsystems

	- *_LocateItem_* If the IOC local database contains the requested item, it responds with an identification sufficient for establishing a route to that item.

	- *_GetValue_* The value of the specified item is obtained.

	- *_PutValue_* A value is transmitted for the specified item.

	- *_StartStream_* A stream of data is transmitted through the indicated route. The IOC system continues to transmit data values until a StopStream command is received.

	- *_StopStream_* The indicated data stream is terminated.

	- *_SetEvent_* An event is established as a monitor of some database entry. Appropriate changes to that entry are to result in the indicated event being transmitted.

	- *_ClearEvent_* A previously set event is terminated.

  

### Non-functional

  

****5.1 Command routing****

  

- The system should allow commands and data routed through a channel which might be a conversion module.

  

****5.4 Data communications****

  

- Communication of information in the system is via routes, which may be a specific subsystem, channel, or broadcast.

  

****5.5 IOC commands****

  

- IOC crates in the Gemini system should have local databases.

- *_LocateItem_* command should be broadcast through the IOC network.

- Time format in the system should be in IRIG-B format as UTC.

- Control subsystems require time synchronization.

  

****5.6 Command implementation****

  

- *_Work Package Descriptions_* should include *_baseline_* command descriptions.

- The system should map the specific IOC command between ASCII strings and EPICS channel.
