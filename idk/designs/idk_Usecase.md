## User Case Descriptions
**Login**: Every user must log in before using the system. (Astronomer, Science Observer, Supporter, Operation Staff, Telescope Operator, Developer, and Administrator).

**Viewing program**: All users can only access the program assigned to their role.

**Create a Science plan**: Astronomers can create a science plan. They can interact with the observing mode in the program and test via a virtual telescope for their science plan and then submit it to the system.

**Validate the Science plan**: Science observers have to validate the science plan that is sent into the system by Astronomers.

**Create an observing program**: Science observers have to create an Observing program for Astronomers and then submit the program to the system.

**Validate the Observing program**: Operation staff has to validate the program before the program can be used by Astronomers.

**Access Operation table**: The Astronomer and Operation staff can access this table but Astronomers can only work in reading mode, Operation staff can access every function of the program.

**Monitor the progress of the science plan**: After the science plan and observing program have been approved. Science observers can keep monitoring the progress execution multiple times.

**Collect astronomical data**: After every plan has been executed. Science observer has to collect astronomical data and then manage and validate the integrity of those data before sending it to the Astronomer.

**Ensuring the integrity of the system**: The Telescope operator has to make sure that the system is integrity all the time when the Astronomer operates the operation.
Investigate the system operation: Administrators determine appropriate observation scheduling changes in the operation.

**Maintain downtime and system modification**: Administrators have to Maintain downtime and system modification in the operation.

**Installing special equipment and sub-systems**: Visitors have to Install special equipment and sub-systems for a telescope.
 Subsystem modification: Developers have to Design, Configure, and Upgrade subsystems for the Gemini system.

**Validate the device and configuration**: Supporters can validate the device and configuration from the visitor and send it to the Operation staff.

**Configure change**: Supporter can configure the system.

**Maintain the system**: Supporter is responsible for the system maintenance.

**Upgrade software**: Supporters are responsible for software upgrades, as well as, installing new configurations. 

**Installation and Access subsystem**: Supporter can install, access subsystems, and test subsystems.
