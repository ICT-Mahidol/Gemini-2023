## Design Pattern
    We used Singleton design pattern for our project because it enable us to ensure that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance. This design pattern prevent other objects use new operator.
    - UserController.java where the ocs is a single instance that is accessible to all clients.
    - SciencePlanController where the ocs is a single instance that is accessible to all science plans.
