14. (3.4.3 A) Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently.
15. (3.4.3 B) Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical in the upper layers (even if the hardware shall differ).
16. (3.4.3 C) Additions of new instrument modifications should be confined to the operational procedures and should not affect the bulk of the existing software.
17. (3.4.3 D) There must be easy procedures to reconfigure the system when subsystems are modified or removed. 
18. (3.4.3 F) The number of main packages of software must be kept to a minimum to facilitate maintenance.
19. (3.4.3 H) Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible.
20. (3.4.3 J) All software that does not directly control specific hardware must be written as machine-independent, portable code.
21. (3.5.4.1) Maintenance of commercial software (Solaris, VxWorks) falls under the responsibility of the WPR, with costs not covered by the work package budget. 


### Design constraints
1. (2.14.4 A) The system shall have different requirements for software running on different layers. For instance, strict real-time control is restricted to the IOC layer. 
2. (2.14.4 B) The Gemini system utilizes a virtual telescope model for independent testing and development of the integrated system. 
3. (2.14.4 C) The Gemini subsystem shall be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface to the rest of the Gemini system. 
4. (2.14.4 D) No subsystem package shall make any assumptions about the surrounding environment beyond that provided in the interface specifications.
